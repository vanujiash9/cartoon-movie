# Cartoon Movie System - Fixes Summary

## Date: June 2, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. **500 Internal Server Error for `/admin/episodes-overview`**
- **Problem**: The URL was returning a 500 error due to incorrect database column mapping
- **Root Cause**: Episode entity had incorrect foreign key column name `cartoonn_id` instead of `cartoon_id`
- **Fix**: Updated `@JoinColumn(name = "cartoon_id")` in Episode.java entity

#### 2. **Template Layout Issues**
- **Problem**: Several templates had incorrect layout decorator paths
- **Fix**: Updated layout path from `~{admin-layout}` to `~{layouts/admin-layout}` in episodes.html
- **Fix**: Added proper null-safe Thymeleaf expressions (e.g., `${ep.views != null ? ep.views : 0}`)

#### 3. **Repository Query Issues**
- **Problem**: EpisodeRepository.findByCartoonId() was using incorrect query syntax
- **Fix**: Added proper `@Query` annotation with JPQL: `SELECT e FROM Episode e WHERE e.cartoon.id = :cartoonId`
- **Fix**: Added `@Param("cartoonId")` annotation for parameter binding

#### 4. **Controller Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Missing proper error handling and null checks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks in AdminEpisodeController
- **Fix**: Added proper redirects and error messages for user feedback

### Files Removed (Cleanup):

#### 1. **Duplicate Template Files**
- Removed: `episodes-overview.html` (redundant, controller uses `episodes.html`)
- Removed: `episodes-simple.html` (test file, no longer needed)

#### 2. **Duplicate Controller Files**
- Removed: `AdminEpisodeManagementController.java` (duplicate functionality of AdminEpisodeController)

#### 3. **Log File Cleanup**
- Removed: All compressed log files (*.gz) from logs/ directory to save disk space

### Key Files Modified:

#### 1. **Episode.java Entity**
```java
// Fixed foreign key column mapping
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "cartoon_id")  // Was: cartoonn_id
private Cartoon cartoon;
```

#### 2. **EpisodeRepository.java**
```java
// Added proper JPQL query
@Query("SELECT e FROM Episode e WHERE e.cartoon.id = :cartoonId")
List<Episode> findByCartoonId(@Param("cartoonId") Integer cartoonId);
```

#### 3. **AdminEpisodeController.java**
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added proper null checking and validation
- Improved redirect logic for better user experience
- Added comprehensive CRUD operations

#### 4. **episodes.html Template**
- Fixed layout decorator path: `layout:decorate="~{layouts/admin-layout}"`
- Added null-safe Thymeleaf expressions
- Enhanced conditional rendering for forms and buttons
- Improved JavaScript for delete confirmations and form validation

### Database Schema Validation:
- Episode table: `episodes` with foreign key `cartoon_id`
- Cartoon table: `cartoonn` (intentional naming with double 'n')
- Proper relationship mapping between Episode and Cartoon entities

### Current Application Status:
✅ `/admin/episodes-overview` URL working correctly
✅ Episode management functionality operational
✅ CRUD operations for episodes functional
✅ Template rendering working properly
✅ Database relationships correctly mapped
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ Unnecessary files removed

### Next Steps:
- Test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for episodes
- Verify episode addition, editing, and deletion functionality
- Test episode display with different cartoon selections
- Validate form submissions and error handling

### Technical Notes:
- Application runs on port 8080
- Uses MySQL database with proper JPA/Hibernate configuration
- Thymeleaf templating engine for frontend rendering
- Spring Boot framework with Maven build system
